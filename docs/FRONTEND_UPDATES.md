### 🔧 Configuration Updates Made

#### 1. Updated `src/config/constants.ts`
- ✅ Added all new payment system contract addresses
- ✅ Added payment system constants (order status, payment status, vehicle types)
- ✅ Improved IPFS gateway configuration with more reliable endpoints
- ✅ Added proper fallback gateways for better reliability

#### 2. Fixed IPFS Issues
- ✅ Updated IPFS gateways to use more reliable endpoints
- ✅ Added proper error handling for gateway failures
- ✅ Configured real Pinata API keys from environment
- ✅ Improved fallback mechanism for IPFS metadata fetching

#### 3. Environment Variables
- ✅ All contract addresses properly configured in `.env`
- ✅ IPFS configuration updated with working API keys
- ✅ Network configuration verified for Lisk Sepolia

### 🚀 New Payment System Constants Available

```typescript
// Order Status Constants
export const ORDER_STATUS = {
  CREATED: 0,
  PAID: 1,
  CONFIRMED: 2,
  IN_TRANSIT: 3,
  DELIVERED: 4,
  COMPLETED: 5,
  CANCELLED: 6,
  DISPUTED: 7,
} as const;

// Payment Status Constants
export const PAYMENT_STATUS = {
  PENDING: 0,
  ESCROWED: 1,
  RELEASED: 2,
  REFUNDED: 3,
  DISPUTED: 4,
} as const;

// Vehicle Types for Transportation
export const VEHICLE_TYPES = {
  TRUCK: 0,
  REFRIGERATED: 1,
  VAN: 2,
  MOTORCYCLE: 3,
} as const;

// Marketplace Listing Status
export const LISTING_STATUS = {
  ACTIVE: 0,
  SOLD: 1,
  COMPLETED: 2,
  CANCELLED: 3,
} as const;
```

### 🔍 Issues Fixed

#### 1. IPFS Gateway Problems
- **Problem**: Frontend was getting 400 errors from IPFS gateways
- **Solution**: Updated to use more reliable IPFS gateways with proper fallback mechanism
- **New Gateways**: 
  - Primary: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs`
  - Fallbacks: Pinata, Cloudflare, Dweb.link, and others

#### 2. Contract Address Mismatches
- **Problem**: Frontend was using old contract addresses
- **Solution**: Updated all contract addresses to match newly deployed contracts
- **Result**: Frontend now connects to the correct payment system contracts

#### 3. Missing Payment System Constants
- **Problem**: No constants defined for payment system enums
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive constants for all payment system states and types
- **Result**: Frontend can now properly handle payment system data

### 🧪 Testing the Updates

#### 1. Verify Contract Connections
```bash
# Start the frontend
npm run dev

# Check browser console for any contract connection errors
# All contract addresses should be properly loaded
```

#### 2. Test IPFS Functionality
- Navigate to the Marketplace page
- Check if crop batch metadata loads properly
- Verify images display correctly
- No more 400 errors in console

#### 3. Test Payment System Integration
- Once payment system UI components are built, test:
  - Creating marketplace listings
  - Placing orders
  - Selecting transporters
  - Processing payments

### 📝 Next Steps for Full Payment System Integration

#### 1. Create Payment System UI Components
- **MarketplaceListings**: Display available crops
- **OrderCreation**: Create purchase orders
- **TransporterSelection**: Choose delivery services
- **PaymentProcessing**: Handle escrow payments
- **OrderTracking**: Real-time delivery tracking

#### 2. Create Payment System Hooks
- **useMarketplace**: Interact with marketplace contract
- **useTransportation**: Manage transporter operations
- **usePayments**: Handle payment processing
- **useOrders**: Manage order lifecycle

#### 3. Update Navigation
- Add payment system pages to navigation
- Create dedicated sections for farmers, buyers, transporters

### 🔗 Contract Integration Examples

```typescript
// Example: Using the new contract addresses
import { CONTRACT_ADDRESSES } from '../config/constants';

// Marketplace contract
const marketplaceAddress = CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.Marketplace;

// Order Manager contract
const orderManagerAddress = CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.OrderManager;

// Payment Processor contract
const paymentProcessorAddress = CONTRACT_ADDRESSES.PaymentProcessor;
```
